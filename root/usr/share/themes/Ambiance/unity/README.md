Unity - Ambiance Theme Blank Icon Background

Changes the background of icons to be transparent, so that it looks like Windows 7.

This is an improvement in my opinion, but your opinion may differ. 

If you like the background as it is, feel free to simply not install this.

To install: (cd to this folder) sudo cp -R * /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/unity/

You can also install all tweaks: (cd to "root" folder) sudo cp -R * /
