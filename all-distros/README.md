A few Linux tools and useful scripts 



A description of each file: 

xfceclock.txt - My preferred clock layout, for XFCE's clock. Similar to ISO-8601.

clearlogs.sh - Removes log files in the /var/log folder. Saves some disk space. 

clsw.sh - Clears swap, by turning it off, then turning it back on. This puts swap back into RAM. 

crash.sh - Crashes the system using a fork bomb. Not actually useful, just for fun. 

fix-vmware.sh - Fixes a problem in VMware that prevents the list of VMs from loading properly. 

netflix.sh - Launches Netflix in a fullscreen window. Note: Google Chrome is required. 

network.sh - Resets the network service, useful whenever a network adapter breaks (rarely).
