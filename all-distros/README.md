A few Linux tools and useful scripts 



A description of each file: 

autoscan.sh - Automatically scans a network printer into a folder. Requires you to specify your printer's address. 

bash_aliases - To be copied to `~/.bash_aliases` if there is not one already present. 

clearlogs.sh - Removes log files in the /var/log folder. Saves some disk space. 

clearswap.sh - Clears swap, by turning it off, then turning it back on. This puts swap back into RAM. 

crash.sh - Crashes the system using a fork bomb. Not actually useful, just for fun. 

dolphin-\*.sh - Causes the mouse to act as a joystick, so you can use the mouse input as joystick input. 

fix-network.sh - Restarts the network service, useful whenever a network adapter breaks (rarely). 

fix-steam-6520g.sh - Fixes a problem with Steam not starting on laptops with an AMD Radeon 6520G GPU. 

fix-vmware-make.sh - I had trouble with VMware, I found this script on Arch forums, no idea how it works. 

xfceclock.txt - My preferred clock layout, for XFCE's clock. Similar to ISO-8601.
