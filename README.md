# Linux-tools

A few Linux tools and useful scripts. I highly recommend checking out `ubuntu-only/setup.sh`.



Descriptions of the contents of the folders are found in a README.md in each folder.

For detailed info on each program, use GitHub commit info, the man pages, and Google search.

Ubuntu users can use everything except the "arch-only" folder.

Arch users can use everything except the "ubuntu-only" folder.

Again, the most important script in this repo is `ubuntu-only/setup.sh`. You should use it!
