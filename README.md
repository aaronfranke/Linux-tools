A few Linux tools and useful scripts 

Scripts created by me, Steam controller udev rule created by Valve. 



A description of each file: 

xfceclock.txt - My preferred clock layout, for XFCE's clock. Similar to ISO-8601.

clearlogs.sh - Removes log files and the entire /var/log folder. Saves some disk space. 

clsw.sh - Clears swap, by turning it off, then turning it back on. This puts swap back into RAM. 

crash.sh - Crashes the system using a fork bomb. Not actually useful, just for fun. 

fix-vmware.sh - Fixes a problem in VMware that prevents the list of VMs from loading properly. 

netflix.sh - Launches Netflix in a fullscreen window. Note: Google Chrome is required. 

network.sh - Resets the network service, useful whenever a network adapter breaks (rarely). 

unity-tools.sh - Installs the Unity desktop, its dependencies, and some useful tools for it. 

update.sh - Updates the system completely. Also removes log files. Does not remove old kernels.

vbox.sh - When VirtualBox is installed through the website, you need to run this each boot to use VBox.

programs-to-install.sh - Contains a list of many useful programs to be installed. Includes updates.


For detailed info on each program, use GitHub commit info, the man pages, and Google search.

Descriptions of the contents of the folders are found in the respective folders.
