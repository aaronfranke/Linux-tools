A few Linux tools and useful scripts 



A description of each file: 

unity-tools.sh - Installs the Unity desktop, its dependencies, and some useful tools for it. 

update.sh - Updates the system completely. Also removes log files. Does not remove old kernels. 

programs-to-install.sh - Installs many useful programs. Includes system updates. 

personal-programs.sh - Some software that I personally want but that I think others may not want.
